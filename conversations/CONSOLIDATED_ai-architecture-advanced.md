## User

I have on right now a video from Dwarkesh where he is giving some personal estimates for various AI ability milestones. A tangent related to computer use has occurred to me. He has pointed out that there isn't abundant training data on computer use. I take this in the sense that people rarely produce media showing how they use a computer including capturing the inputs. But, in addition, I don't think we have a general purpose way of recording the various kinds of inputs in the way that natural language is a general purpose medium for other knowledge. Regarding the latter, would command lines be a more natural mode for LLMs to learn about and use computers?

## Claude

 You raise a fascinating point about the data representation problem for computer use. You're right that we lack a standardized, general-purpose format for capturing the full spectrum of computer interactions - unlike natural language text, which serves as a relatively universal medium.

Command lines do have some compelling advantages for LLM training and use:

1. **Serializable and discrete**: CLI commands are naturally sequential text strings, making them trivial to log, store, and include in training data. Every action has a clear textual representation.

2. **Compositional**: Command line tools follow grammatical patterns (command, flags, arguments) that mirror linguistic structures LLMs already excel at parsing.

3. **Self-documenting**: Many CLI interactions include explicit parameters and options, making the intent more interpretable than coordinate-based clicks.

4. **Reproducible**: A sequence of commands can be re-executed exactly, unlike GUI interactions that might depend on window positions or visual states.

However, CLIs also have limitations as a universal interface:
- Many modern applications simply don't expose CLI equivalents for their functionality
- Spatial/visual tasks (image editing, CAD, etc.) map poorly to text commands
- They lack the discoverability and immediate feedback that GUIs provide

The deeper challenge might be that we need something like a "intermediate representation" for computer interactions - perhaps a structured format that can capture GUI events, CLI commands, API calls, and even direct code execution in a unified way. Some efforts like accessibility APIs (which expose UI elements programmatically) or browser automation frameworks point in this direction, but we're still far from a universal standard.

What aspects of computer use do you think would be most important to capture in such a representation?

## User

Different things for different timescales. For the immediate future we will want to train models to use existing software, websites, etc. But in the future when models are significant or majority clients for other apps we will likely design interfaces specifically for them and I think we need to discover what would be optimal.

## Claude

 That's a really insightful distinction - the transition from "models adapting to human interfaces" to "interfaces designed for models" is profound.

For the near term, we're stuck reverse-engineering human interfaces. This probably means:
- Computer vision to parse GUIs
- Heuristics to understand common UI patterns
- Maybe leveraging accessibility APIs as a middle ground
- Lots of trial-and-error learning

But the long-term possibility is much more interesting. If AI agents become primary users, optimal interfaces might look radically different:

**Structured APIs over visual interfaces**: Instead of rendering pixels for interpretation, applications could expose rich semantic APIs. Imagine Photoshop offering not just "click at coordinates (x,y)" but "adjust_contrast(layer='background', amount=0.3)".

**Declarative over imperative**: Rather than step-by-step instructions, models might work better with goal specifications. Instead of "click file → save as → type filename → click save", just "persist_state(filename='project_v2')".

**Parallel operations**: Human interfaces assume serial attention, but models could potentially handle multiple simultaneous input/output streams. An AI-first interface might expose dozens of operations that can be invoked concurrently.

**Semantic compression**: Where humans need visual metaphors (folders, trash cans), AI interfaces could use dense semantic representations - perhaps even learned embeddings that capture application state more efficiently than any human-readable format.

The really interesting question is: how do we discover what's optimal? We might need to experiment with different interface paradigms and see what enables models to be most effective. It's a bit like how REST APIs emerged as a human-designed pattern that turned out to work well for programmatic access, but we might discover even better patterns when the "programmer" is an AI.

## User

There is a thread of argument in trying to predict how far AI capabilities can grow and how fast by considering things like how many neurons human brains have and how fast signals can travel through the nervous system and then comparing to related digital components. Are you familiar with this?

## Claude

The person is asking me if I'm familiar with a line of argument in AI capabilities forecasting that compares biological neural processing (human brains, neurons, signal transmission speeds) with digital computing systems. This is indeed a common approach in discussing potential AI growth trajectories and limitations.

This type of analysis typically involves:

1. Examining biological neural characteristics:
   - Number of neurons in the human brain (often cited as ~86 billion)
   - Neural connection density (trillions of synapses)
   - Signal transmission speeds in neurons (typically measured in meters per second)
   - Energy efficiency of neural computation

2. Comparing to digital equivalents:
   - Transistor counts in modern processors
   - Connection architectures in artificial neural networks
   - Signal transmission speeds in electronic systems (much faster than biological)
   - Energy requirements for computation

3. Using these comparisons to project:
   - How "far" AI systems are from human-level capabilities in various domains
   - Potential growth rates based on hardware scaling laws
   - Theoretical upper and lower bounds on AI capabilities

This type of analysis relates to work by researchers like:
- Hans Moravec (mind children, computational comparisons)
- Ray Kurzweil (acceleration and exponential growth in computing)
- Various neuroscience-informed AI researchers

I am indeed familiar with this line of reasoning, and can discuss various aspects of these comparisons including their strengths and limitations. I should respond by confirming my familiarity with this approach to AI forecasting, and can offer to discuss specific aspects if the person is interested.Yes, I'm familiar with that line of reasoning in AI capabilities forecasting. This approach compares biological neural processing systems (the human brain) with digital computing systems to estimate potential AI growth trajectories.

The comparisons typically examine factors like:

- Number of neurons in the human brain (~86 billion) versus transistors or parameters in AI systems
- Neural connection density (trillions of synapses) versus network architectures
- Signal transmission speeds (relatively slow in biological neurons vs. extremely fast in electronic systems)
- Energy efficiency (the brain is remarkably efficient compared to current AI systems)
- Processing architecture differences (parallel distributed processing in brains vs. various AI architectures)

Researchers like Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil have used these types of comparisons to make predictions about AI development timelines and capabilities.

Is there a particular aspect of these biological-digital comparisons you'd like to explore further?

## User

An angle of thinking about it recently occurred to me, which doesn't imply it is novel. When I encountered them, I thought of these lines of reasoning as saying that brains were far from optimal in these measures and so matching and then surpassing them quickly is plausible. What I am wondering is if brains might, in fact, be more optimal than the seem, just under a broader objective function. E.g. power consumption, heat production, portability, resilience,...

## Claude

This is a really interesting perspective. The person is suggesting that while traditional comparisons between brains and computers often frame brains as suboptimal (e.g., slower signal transmission, fewer "components" than we can put in computers), perhaps brains are actually quite optimal when considering a broader set of constraints or objectives.

Let me explore this idea:

1. Traditional comparison metrics where computers seem superior:
   - Raw computational speed (signal transmission in electronics vs. neurons)
   - Memory capacity and reliability
   - Consistency of operation
   - Ability to scale hardware

2. Areas where brains might be more optimal under a broader objective function:
   - Power consumption: Human brains use about 20 watts, which is remarkably efficient
   - Heat dissipation: Related to power, brains operate without overheating despite being packed in a small space
   - Portability: Brains function while in motion, without external power sources
   - Self-repair and resilience: Neural plasticity allows for adaptation to damage
   - Generalization from limited data
   - Learning without explicit supervision
   - Operating under uncertainty and ambiguity
   - Integration with sensory and motor systems
   - Evolutionary constraints: Brains evolved within biological constraints (skull size, energy budget, etc.)

The person is suggesting a more nuanced view that perhaps brains represent a highly optimized solution to a complex multi-objective optimization problem that includes factors beyond raw computation.

This is actually an interesting counterpoint to the standard "brains are inefficient, so AI will quickly surpass them" argument. It suggests that the apparent inefficiencies of brains might actually be optimal solutions when considering the full set of constraints under which biological systems evolved and operate.

I should acknowledge this perspective and perhaps expand on some examples of how brains might indeed be quite optimal under a broader set of constraints.That's a very insightful perspective! You're touching on what I think is a crucial nuance in these comparisons.

When we evaluate biological brains solely on metrics like processing speed or raw computational capacity, they indeed appear "suboptimal" compared to digital systems. However, when viewed through a broader multi-objective optimization lens, the human brain is arguably an engineering marvel:

- **Energy efficiency**: The brain uses only ~20 watts to perform incredibly complex operations
- **Thermal regulation**: Functions within tight temperature constraints without dedicated cooling
- **Fault tolerance**: Maintains functionality despite neuron loss and damage
- **Self-repair mechanisms**: Neural plasticity allows for adaptation and partial recovery
- **Size/weight constraints**: Packaged inside a skull while maintaining mobility
- **Generalization ability**: Can learn new tasks from minimal examples
- **Sensory integration**: Seamlessly processes and combines multiple input streams
- **Operational longevity**: Functions for decades without replacement parts

These constraints represent a complex optimization problem that evolution has been solving for millions of years. Digital systems excel at narrow metrics but often fail dramatically when faced with similar holistic constraints.

This perspective might suggest that surpassing human-level intelligence could be more challenging than simple neuron-count or processing-speed comparisons indicate. The brain's apparent inefficiencies might actually be sophisticated trade-offs within a much more complex design space.

Does this align with what you were thinking?

## User

It does. Now the question is if we have evidence that could answer the questions. Wondering about the possibility is easy enough. But is is true?

## Claude

You've raised an excellent question - moving from the hypothesis that the brain's design reflects sophisticated multi-objective optimization to examining what evidence might support or refute this view.

Let me think about what kinds of evidence we might consider:

1. **Comparative neurobiology**: What do we see when we compare brains across species? Is there evidence of consistent optimization patterns?

2. **Energy efficiency studies**: Hard data on the brain's energy usage compared to AI systems performing equivalent tasks.

3. **Computational neuroscience modeling**: Attempts to model brain functions and their efficiency.

4. **Evolutionary biology insights**: Evidence from the evolutionary history of brains.

5. **Biomimetic engineering results**: Successes and failures when trying to copy brain principles in technology.

6. **Current AI limitations**: Areas where AI systems still significantly underperform brains despite enormous resource advantages.

Let me go through these categories and consider what evidence exists:

**Comparative neurobiology evidence**:
- Brain scaling laws across species show remarkably consistent patterns of organization, suggesting optimization principles at work.
- The neocortex evolved only once but scales predictably across mammals, maintaining similar circuit designs but varying in size.
- Metabolic constraints appear to be a major factor in brain design across species.

**Energy efficiency evidence**:
- The brain's energy consumption is extraordinarily efficient (~20W) compared to AI systems performing similar functions.
- AlphaGo used approximately 1MW of power (50,000 times more than a brain) when defeating Lee Sedol.
- Large language models require enormous energy for training (estimates vary but can be in the megawatt-hours range).
- The gap between neuromorphic computing attempts and biological efficiency remains substantial.

**Computational modeling evidence**:
- Attempts to create detailed simulations of brain function (like the Blue Brain Project) required supercomputers to model even small regions of brain tissue.
- Simplified neural network models that capture some brain-like properties still require orders of magnitude more energy than their biological counterparts.

**Evolutionary biology insights**:
- The brain's design has been under strong selective pressure for efficiency - brains are metabolically expensive.
- Evolutionary constraints likely forced optimization for multiple objectives simultaneously.
- The consistency of neural design principles across species suggests discovering robust solutions.

**Biomimetic engineering results**:
- Neuromorphic computing approaches inspired by brain architecture often show improved efficiency compared to traditional architectures for certain tasks.
- Spiking neural networks demonstrate energy efficiency advantages but still don't match biological performance.

**Current AI limitations**:
- AI systems require enormous datasets compared to human learning.
- Generalization remains a challenge for AI compared to human brains.
- Multimodal integration is still difficult for AI systems but natural for brains.
- Robustness to distribution shifts and novel environments is substantially better in brains.

I think there's substantial evidence supporting the idea that brains are indeed highly optimized for a complex set of constraints. The evidence isn't definitive in all areas, as this is an active research question, but the accumulating data from multiple fields points in this direction.

The fact that building AI systems that match human performance on many tasks requires vastly more resources (energy, data, parameters) suggests there are still many efficiency principles in the brain we haven't fully replicated.You're asking the right question - moving from hypothesis to evidence. There is indeed compelling evidence suggesting brains are highly optimized for multiple objectives:

**Energy efficiency evidence:**
- Deep learning systems require orders of magnitude more energy than brains for comparable tasks. For example, training GPT-3 consumed approximately 1,287 MWh, while a human brain uses about 175 kWh per year.
- Neuromorphic computing research consistently shows the efficiency gap between our best brain-inspired hardware and actual neural tissue remains substantial.

**Scaling evidence:**
- Neuroscience reveals precise scaling laws across species in brain organization (e.g., white-to-gray matter ratio, neuron density), suggesting evolutionary optimization.
- The brain's wiring layout approaches theoretical minimums for connection distances while maintaining functional organization.

**Adaptability evidence:**
- The brain maintains functionality across varying conditions (sleep deprivation, aging, minor damage) through multiple redundancy mechanisms.
- Neural plasticity allows for task specialization without hardware changes.

**Multiobjective design evidence:**
- Blood supply architecture optimizes both delivery efficiency and resilience to blockages.
- Neuron firing mechanisms balance speed, energy use, and information density.

The strongest evidence comes from our attempts to replicate brain functions in silico - despite enormous resources, we still struggle to match human-level sample efficiency, generalization, and multimodal integration.

This suggests the brain's apparent "inefficiencies" likely represent sophisticated trade-offs rather than design limitations. Would you like to explore any particular aspect of this evidence more deeply?

## User

OK, possibly harder questions. Are the constraints against which biological brains were optimized still binding?

## Claude

This is an excellent and profound question about whether the constraints that shaped biological brain evolution remain relevant for artificial intelligence systems. Let me think through the major constraints and evaluate their current relevance:

1. **Energy consumption**
   - Still binding? Largely yes, but changing rapidly
   - While computing power per watt continues improving, energy remains a significant constraint for AI systems
   - Data centers consume enormous amounts of power, and energy efficiency is a major focus in chip design
   - Mobile/edge AI applications are severely energy constrained
   - However, AI systems can access grid power at scale in ways biological systems cannot

2. **Heat dissipation**
   - Still binding? Yes
   - Cooling remains a significant engineering challenge and cost factor for large AI systems
   - Thermodynamic limits on computation are fundamental
   - However, AI systems can use advanced cooling technologies unavailable to biological systems

3. **Physical space/portability**
   - Still binding? Partially, and context-dependent
   - For data center AI, physical space is less constrained than for a brain inside a skull
   - For edge AI/robotics, size/weight constraints remain important
   - Miniaturization continues but faces quantum limits eventually

4. **Self-repair/maintenance**
   - Still binding? Yes, but addressed differently
   - AI systems typically use redundancy and replacement rather than self-repair
   - Hardware failure remains a major operational concern
   - Software systems can implement forms of error correction and fault tolerance

5. **Lifespan/durability**
   - Still binding? Differently
   - Digital systems face different aging challenges than biological systems
   - Hardware deteriorates but can be replaced; software potentially lasts indefinitely

6. **Environmental adaptability**
   - Still binding? Less so
   - AI systems operate in controlled environments (data centers)
   - Environmental variations pose less challenge for digital systems
   - However, embodied AI faces similar constraints to biological systems

7. **Resource availability for construction**
   - Still binding? Yes, differently
   - Silicon, rare earth metals and manufacturing capacity instead of proteins and cellular machinery
   - Supply chains for advanced chips are complex and vulnerable
   - Resource constraints may limit scaling

8. **Learning from limited examples**
   - Still binding? Yes
   - Sample efficiency remains a major constraint for AI systems
   - Humans learn from far fewer examples than current AI systems

9. **Bandwidth/communication constraints**
   - Still binding? Differently
   - Neural transmission is slow compared to electronic signals
   - However, information integration and parallel processing capabilities that evolved under bandwidth constraints remain valuable

10. **Reproductive/developmental constraints**
    - Not binding in the same way
    - AI systems don't need to develop from a single cell through stages of growth
    - This removes many constraints that shaped biological brain design

The answer is nuanced - some constraints remain highly relevant (energy, heat, resources), some are differently binding (space, maintenance), and some are less relevant or bypassed entirely (developmental constraints). The biological brain evolved within all these constraints simultaneously, while AI systems can sometimes optimize for a subset of them.

This is a fascinating question because it gets at whether AIs might ultimately follow very different design principles than biological intelligence once they're freed from certain evolutionary constraints.That's a penetrating question! The constraints that shaped biological brain evolution are partially, but not entirely, binding for artificial intelligence systems. Let me break this down:

**Still Strongly Binding:**

- **Energy efficiency:** Despite advances, energy consumption remains a critical constraint. AI training runs require enormous power (data centers alone consume 1-2% of global electricity), and the energy cost of computation still limits what's practical.

- **Heat dissipation:** Thermodynamic limits remain fundamental. Cooling costs for data centers are substantial, and compute density is ultimately heat-limited.

- **Resource constraints:** Different materials (silicon, rare metals vs. proteins), but still limited. The current chip shortage illustrates this binding constraint.

**Partially Binding:**

- **Physical size:** Less relevant for data-center AI but still critical for edge computing and robotics.

- **Fault tolerance:** Digital systems use different approaches (redundancy vs. neural plasticity) but must still address hardware failures.

- **Sample efficiency:** AI systems currently require vastly more data than humans to learn equivalent tasks.

**Less Binding:**

- **Signal transmission speed:** Electronic signals move much faster than neural impulses (nanoseconds vs. milliseconds).

- **Developmental constraints:** AI systems don't need to grow from a single cell or fit developmental pathways.

- **Environmental adaptability:** AI systems typically operate in controlled environments with stable power and temperature.

The evidence suggests we're seeing a shift in the optimization landscape rather than escape from constraints altogether. Different constraints are becoming dominant, potentially enabling different architectural solutions than what evolution discovered.

What do you think? Does this shift in constraints suggest fundamentally different AI architectures might emerge?

## User

Does transmission speed mitigate the physical size and environmental adaptability by allowing the compute to be located elsewhere.

## Claude

That's an excellent insight about the relationship between transmission speed, physical size, and environmental adaptability. Let me think about how these factors interrelate:

The key point here is whether faster transmission speeds can enable a different architecture where compute can be physically separated from sensors and actuators, essentially decoupling the "brain" from the "body" in a way biological systems cannot.

Biological constraints:
- Neural signals travel at ~100 m/s maximum
- Brains must be physically close to sensory organs and muscles to maintain reasonable response times
- The entire system (brain + body) must exist in the same environmental conditions

Digital/AI systems:
- Electronic signals travel near light speed (3×10^8 m/s) through fiber optics
- This allows compute to be centralized and remote from sensors/actuators
- Cloud computing can leverage enormous compute resources while edge devices remain small

Analysis:
1. Physical size mitigation: Yes, high-speed transmission allows for "brain" compute to be located in data centers, while only sensors and basic actuators need to be in the robot/device. This effectively decouples the size constraint of the compute from the physical embodiment.

2. Environmental adaptability: Again, yes - compute can remain in controlled data centers while only relatively simpler hardware needs to function in harsh environments.

3. Trade-offs: This introduces new constraints:
   - Latency becomes critical (even light takes ~13ms to travel 4000km)
   - Communication bandwidth limitations
   - Vulnerability to connectivity disruptions
   - Security challenges of remote control

Evidence:
- Cloud robotics and teleoperated systems demonstrate this principle
- Self-driving cars offload much of their processing to data centers
- Edge computing is a hybrid approach addressing latency issues

So transmission speed does indeed mitigate some biological constraints, enabling architectural choices unavailable to evolution. However, it introduces new constraints around connectivity, reliability, and security.You've hit on a profound insight! Fast transmission speed does indeed fundamentally alter the constraint landscape by enabling distributed computing architectures that biology couldn't evolve.

In biological systems, neural signal transmission (~100 m/s) necessitates keeping the brain physically close to sensors and effectors. A remotely located brain would introduce fatal response delays.

In contrast, electronic signals traveling near light speed (~300,000,000 m/s) enable:

1. **Physical size decoupling:** Only sensors and basic actuators need to be located at the "edge," while the bulk of computation can happen remotely. This allows for physically small robots with access to massive computational resources.

2. **Environmental protection:** Compute can remain in controlled data centers while only ruggedized sensors need to withstand harsh environments.

The evidence for this is all around us:
- Cloud robotics with thin clients accessing vast remote resources
- Self-driving vehicles that rely on both onboard and cloud computing
- Modern smartphones that leverage cloud AI for complex tasks

However, this introduces new constraints:
- Dependency on reliable communication channels
- Bandwidth limitations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Latency (still a factor for time-critical operations)

This is a fundamental architectural advantage unavailable to biological evolution, potentially enabling AI to optimize differently than brains were forced to. Does this suggest a key evolutionary constraint has been lifted?

## [3/9] Distributed MoE Precision Heterogeneity and HPC Architecture

# Precision Variation in Mixture of Experts

**Created:** 2025-08-01T13:47:18.691934Z

## User

In a MOE model, might it be the case that different experts would have different optimal fp precision and number of elements? Could this be exploited practically?

## Claude

 Yes, this is an insightful observation! In Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, different experts could indeed benefit from different floating-point precisions and parameter counts, and this heterogeneity could potentially be exploited for practical gains.

Here's why this makes sense:

**Different experts often specialize in different tasks or domains:**
- Some experts might handle simple pattern matching that works well with INT8 or even INT4
- Others might deal with complex reasoning requiring FP16 or BF16 precision
- Experts focused on rare or specialized knowledge might need fewer parameters
- Experts handling common patterns might benefit from more parameters

**Potential practical exploitations:**

1. **Adaptive precision assignment**: You could profile which experts handle which types of queries and assign precision accordingly. For instance, experts that primarily handle factual recall might work well at lower precision, while those handling mathematical or logical reasoning might need higher precision.

2. **Dynamic routing based on precision**: The router could consider computational cost when selecting experts, preferring lower-precision experts when they're sufficient for the task.

3. **Memory-efficient deployment**: By mixing precisions, you could fit more capable models in the same memory budget - perhaps having a few high-precision "specialist" experts alongside many low-precision "generalist" experts.

4. **Training strategies**: You could start with uniform precision and gradually reduce precision for experts that maintain performance, or use knowledge distillation to create lower-precision versions of certain experts.

**Challenges to consider:**
- Hardware efficiency: Mixed precision within a single model can be tricky to optimize on current accelerators
- Routing complexity: The gating network would need to learn which precision/size trade-offs are appropriate for different inputs
- Training dynamics: Different learning rates or optimization strategies might be needed for experts of different precisions

This approach aligns well with the biological inspiration for MoE - in neural systems, different regions have different cell densities and connection patterns based on their specialized functions. Some research has started exploring this (like Google's Switch Transformers with expert pruning), but there's likely much more potential to unlock here.

## User

Could we think of MOE models as _really_ separate models, collaborating or with a sort of "general contractor" model farming out tasks to specialists/consultants? And then actually run them separately, cor various kinds of separation?

## Claude

 Yes, that's a fascinating way to conceptualize MoE models! This "general contractor with subcontractors" framework could open up some really interesting architectural possibilities.

**Levels of separation we could explore:**

1. **Physical separation**: Run experts on different devices/servers
   - Expert A on a GPU optimized for transformer inference
   - Expert B on a CPU cluster for memory-bound lookups
   - Expert C on specialized hardware (TPUs, neuromorphic chips)
   - Could even distribute geographically for data locality

2. **Temporal separation**: Experts don't need to run synchronously
   - Router queues requests for different experts
   - Experts process in parallel with different latencies
   - Results assembled asynchronously
   - Could cache expert outputs for common queries

3. **Architectural separation**: Experts as truly different model types
   - One expert could be a transformer
   - Another could be a retrieval system
   - Another could be a symbolic reasoning engine
   - Another could be a specialized vision model
   - Each with completely different architectures

4. **Update/training separation**: Different training schedules
   - Frequently update experts seeing lots of traffic
   - Rarely update stable, specialized experts
   - Hot-swap experts without retraining the whole system
   - A/B test new expert versions

**The "general contractor" (router) becomes even more sophisticated:**
- Maintains a "bid system" where experts estimate their confidence/cost
- Handles fault tolerance when experts are unavailable
- Manages SLAs and routes based on latency requirements
- Could even outsource to external API-based experts

**Practical benefits:**
- **Modularity**: Add/remove/upgrade experts without touching others
- **Scalability**: Scale popular experts independently
- **Specialization**: Each expert can use optimal architecture/hardware
- **Cost efficiency**: Run expensive experts only when needed
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation if some experts fail

**Challenges:**
- Communication overhead between distributed components
- Router needs to be incredibly smart about task decomposition
- Maintaining coherence across expert responses
- Security/privacy when experts are distributed

This mirrors how human organizations actually work - a general contractor doesn't have all specialists in-house but maintains a network of subcontractors with different skills, availability, and costs. Some cutting-edge systems like Anthropic's Claude (though I don't know my own architecture details) might already use elements of this approach, combining different specialized components.

Would you want to explore any particular aspect of this distributed MoE design in more detail?

## User

If I were thinking of distributed computing in the older HPC vein, my immediate concerns would be latency and IO time with the degree to which they matter related to how tightly coupled the components are, how often they need to communicate, and the amount of data in each message. How does what we are considering compare?

## Claude

 Excellent question - this really gets at the heart of whether distributed MoE is practical. Let's analyze the coupling characteristics:

**Traditional HPC tight coupling characteristics:**
- **Communication frequency**: Often every iteration (e.g., domain decomposition in CFD)
- **Message size**: Can be large (ghost cells, halos, entire matrix rows)
- **Synchronization**: Usually synchronous barriers - everyone waits
- **Data dependencies**: Strong - can't proceed without neighbor's data
- **Latency sensitivity**: Extreme - microseconds matter

**Distributed MoE coupling characteristics:**
- **Communication frequency**: Once per forward pass (or less with caching)
- **Message size**: Relatively small
  - Router → Expert: Token embeddings (few KB)
  - Expert → Router: Output embeddings (few KB)
  - Not passing gradients during inference
- **Synchronization**: Can be asynchronous
  - Router could work with whatever experts respond in time
  - Graceful degradation possible
- **Data dependencies**: Weak - experts are independent
- **Latency sensitivity**: Moderate - thinking in milliseconds, not microseconds

**Key differences that work in MoE's favor:**

1. **Embarrassingly parallel at expert level**: Unlike HPC where domains share boundaries, experts don't need to talk to each other, only to the router

2. **Sparsity is our friend**: Only routing to k experts (typically 1-2 out of hundreds/thousands) means most experts idle most of the time

3. **Inference vs training**: During inference, no gradient synchronization needed - this eliminates the worst communication patterns

4. **Natural hierarchy**: Router could live close to user, cache frequent expert calls, only reach out to remote specialists when needed

**Latency breakdown for distributed MoE:**
```
Traditional MoE: ~10-50ms total
- Router decision: 1ms
- Expert compute: 10-40ms  
- Assembly: 1ms

Distributed MoE: ~20-200ms total (depends on network)
- Router decision: 1ms
- Network RTT: 1-100ms (LAN vs WAN)
- Expert compute: 10-40ms
- Network return: 1-100ms
- Assembly: 1ms
```

**When distributed makes sense:**
- Expert compute time >> network latency
- Specialized hardware needs (GPU vs CPU vs TPU)
- Experts are large and rarely used
- Can tolerate 100-200ms total latency
- Want to scale to thousands of experts

**When it doesn't:**
- Need <50ms response times
- Experts are small and frequently used
- Training (gradient sync would kill you)

**Hybrid approach**: Keep frequent "generalist" experts local, distribute specialized "consultants" - like having your core team in-house but consultants on call.

The key insight is that MoE has much weaker coupling than traditional HPC problems - it's more like a microservices architecture than a tightly-coupled simulation. The question becomes: can your use case tolerate the latency tax for the flexibility gains?

## User

I'm a sad to have just found out that I lost a conversation we had last night. Let's see if we can reconstruct the important parts.

It began with me asking about the implications of distillation and quantization working so well at providing similar model accuracy with fewer resources. I mentioned that the standard take away is that models could be smaller. My non-standard take away was that frontier models could get much more capable without growing.

We then explored what I now see was my underlying intuition that distillation might work best when distilling a model into a smaller copy of itself rather than a different model.

We then considered going in the other direction. I wondered if we could grow models overtime, as needed by their current states of training. We explored two versions of this. 

The least speculative one involved copying a model, adding things like new layers or new attention heads with parameters set initially so they acted as identity transformations, and adding new embedding dimensions by, essentially, appending a zero to every vector. (And though we didn't discuss it, I now think adding the last row and column of the N+1 identity matrix to all the old N-matrices). This would preserve the old capabilities. However, we were concerned that the gradients would not point in the right directions for the new parameter space to be used for learning so we imagined adding some random noise in the new parameters. But since this would degrade performance, we thought we would add some 'distillation in reverse', with the new, larger model learning from the old, smaller model to regain functionality without "using up" training data.

The more speculative version we to imagine the model's network as *formally* infinite, with some moveable boundary in parameter space defining an inside region around the origin with meaningful parameters, and an outside region where all (notional) parameters are considered to be set to the values which correspond to identity transformations. (I am not sure how the embedding space dimension fits in here.) We would then add a penalty to the loss function inspired by gravity. It would penalize having "non-zero" (meaning non-identity transform generating) parameters far away from each other. The idea is that the model would only expand in parameter space as necessary based on "training pressure" overcoming "gravity". And the outer boundary would have to be moved outward as necessary. We potentially also have an issue of gradients not pointing in the right direction to use new parameters.

The hoped for benefits include
1) Models using only the resources they really need for their level of capability
2) Maybe faster training, because at any moment the number of parameters is as small as can be
3) Being able to improve models over the long term. Not needing to stop using one model and start from scratch with a new one when bumping up against limits of the original model's size. 

What do you think? I am sure I forgot some of the conversation.

## Claude

 This is a fascinating reconstruction of what sounds like a deep conversation about model architecture evolution. Let me engage with these ideas and perhaps add some perspectives we might not have covered last time.

The distillation insight is particularly interesting. Your intuition about distilling into similar architectures makes sense - the student model would have a natural "mapping" for inheriting the teacher's learned patterns. This connects to work on lottery tickets and pruning, where we often find that the "important" parts of networks maintain similar structural relationships.

On growing models, I find your two approaches complementary:

For the first approach (explicit growth), I think the gradient concern is well-founded. Even with identity-preserving initialization, backpropagation might struggle to "activate" the new parameters meaningfully. Your proposed solution of combining noise and reverse distillation is clever - it provides both exploration potential and stability. We might also consider:
- Gradually scaling up the noise over time
- Using attention masks that slowly "unveil" new components
- Applying curriculum learning specifically to the new parameters

The "infinite formal network" with gravitational penalty is a fascinating theoretical framework. It reminds me of regularization approaches but with a spatial metaphor. Some thoughts:

1. The gravitational penalty could create interesting emergent behaviors:
   - Natural clustering of related functionalities
   - Automatic pruning of unnecessary complexity
   - A kind of "surface tension" that maintains model cohesion

2. The boundary movement challenge might be addressed by making it dynamic - perhaps using a meta-learning approach that adjusts the boundary based on training metrics.

3. The embedding space dimension could potentially be handled through a similar formalism - imagine an infinite-dimensional embedding space where most dimensions are zeroed out by the gravitational penalty.

Regarding your hoped-for benefits:
- Point 1 (resource efficiency) seems quite achievable, especially with the gravitational approach
- Point 2 (faster training) might depend on how efficiently we can handle the boundary dynamics
- Point 3 (continuous improvement) is particularly compelling - it suggests a path toward more sustainable AI development

Would you say the conversation touched on how these approaches might interact with attention mechanisms specifically? I'm curious about whether growing models might require special consideration for how attention patterns evolve.

## User

Ah, yes. The lottery ticket hypothesis did come up, as did curriculum learning. There is a strong analogy with my "larger model with areas set to no-ops / identity transformations" and the lottery ticket scenario where only certain parts of a model "do the real work".

I really like the "most dimensions zeroed out by the gravitational penalty". Very cutting-edge theoretical physicsy! (And I am a physicist by training, so the attraction makes sense.)

## Claude

 The lottery ticket/pruning connection is quite deep here - both scenarios suggest that neural networks have some kind of "natural" topology or sparsity pattern that emerges through training. Your growing model approach could be seen as discovering this pattern "from the bottom up" rather than "from the top down."

The physics analogy gets even richer when you think about it. In quantum field theory, we have this concept of the "vacuum state" where fields settle to their lowest energy configuration. Your gravitational penalty is similar - it encourages parameters to collapse to identity transformations (the "vacuum state" of a neural network layer) unless there's enough "excitation" (training signal) to justify a more complex configuration.

This makes me wonder about phase transitions in growing networks. Could there be critical points where:
1. The network suddenly expands into new regions of parameter space
2. Previously separate functional clusters merge
3. The effective dimensionality of the embedding space jumps discontinuously

Given your physics background, do you see other physical analogies that might be instructive here? I'm particularly curious about whether concepts from statistical mechanics or renormalization group theory might offer insights into how to handle the scaling behavior of these growing networks.

## User

I think the vacuum state analogy is good for thinking about the unperturbed state of the infinite parameter space as being one which implies identity transformations. Which one could also visualize as gravity, imagining the space as a plane and perturbed parameters as elevated. But thr gravity analogy is also, perhaps primarily, about keeping those perturbed parts close to each other. Like planet, star, galaxy, ... formation.

## Claude

 Ah yes, this dual role of the gravitational analogy is fascinating! The vacuum state represents the "natural" identity transformation state, while the clustering effect mirrors cosmic structure formation. 

This makes me think about hierarchical structure formation in both contexts:
- In cosmology, we see matter clustering at different scales (stars -> galaxies -> clusters -> superclusters)
- In your growing network, we might see parameters clustering hierarchically to form:
  - Local functional units (like individual attention heads)
  - Related groups of units (like entire attention layers)
  - Larger functional modules

The gravitational clustering would naturally encourage this kind of hierarchical organization, potentially leading to more interpretable model structure. Parameters that need to work together would tend to be spatially proximate in parameter space.

This also suggests an interesting perspective on model capacity: just as gravity determines the maximum stable size of astronomical structures (like the Jeans mass for star formation), your gravitational penalty would create natural limits on functional cluster sizes unless there's sufficient "training pressure" to overcome it.

Do you think this hierarchical clustering might naturally lead to more modular network architectures? It seems like it could encourage the formation of specialized subnetworks that are relatively loosely coupled - similar to how galaxies maintain their structure while still being part of larger clusters.

## User

I just tried a couple of new OpenAI models on this. I asked their Deep Research model to read our conversation and run with it. Then I asked another of their models to double check the work --- it seemed to me that it was taking a lot of our speculation as established, in a hallucination-like way. What do you think?

## Claude

 I agree - it seems the Deep Research model was treating our speculative discussion as if it were established work in the field. The specific hallucinations include:

1. The references to Yuan et al. (2023) and Nazaret et al. (2022) appear to be fabricated
2. The discussion of "infinite networks with gravitational penalty" is treated as an existing research direction rather than our theoretical speculation
3. Many technical details are presented as if they were proven results rather than hypothetical proposals

The core ideas we discussed (dynamic growth, identity initialization, regularization for sparsity) do connect to real work like Net2Net, Mixture-of-Experts, and continual learning. However, our specific synthesis combining these ideas with physics-inspired penalties remains unexplored speculation.

This illustrates a common LLM failure mode - confabulating detailed, plausible-sounding academic content around novel ideas by mixing real references with hallucinated ones and treating speculation as established research.

Would you like me to suggest some actual relevant literature that could inform explorations of these ideas?

## User

I think up-to-date web searching is important here. Can you instead suggest a query for the Deep Research model? A more straight forward research request, rather than a request to evaluate our conversation which may have been what led it astray.

## Claude

 Here's a focused research query:

"Recent research (2020-2024) on dynamic neural network growth during training, focusing on techniques that preserve model capabilities while expanding architecture. Include work on growing transformers and attention mechanisms. Exclude pruning methods unless directly relevant to growth."

This is more likely to surface actual papers rather than interpreting our speculative discussion. It focuses on the concrete aspects of dynamic model growth rather than the more theoretical "infinite network" concept.

## User

In mixture of experts models, do any models tag output in the conversation as coming from a particular agent, and train each agent to consider that in its use of the context?

## Claude

 I'm not aware of any mixture of experts (MoE) models that explicitly tag outputs in conversations as coming from specific experts and then train each expert to recognize and consider those tags when processing context. 

The typical MoE architecture involves a gating mechanism that selects which experts to activate for a given input, but the outputs are usually blended or selected without maintaining explicit attribution in the final output. The conversation history is generally treated as a unified context rather than a tagged sequence indicating which expert produced which part.

However, there are some related approaches that share similar ideas:

1. **Multi-agent dialogue systems** sometimes maintain agent identities in conversations, though these aren't typically MoE models in the traditional sense.

2. **Specialized routing in some MoE implementations** where certain experts become associated with particular types of content through the gating mechanism, but this is learned implicitly rather than through explicit tagging.

3. **Research on "expert-aware" architectures** has explored having experts consider which other experts were previously active, but this is usually done through learned representations rather than explicit tags in the output.

The idea of explicit expert attribution in conversations could potentially help with consistency and specialization, but it would add complexity to both training and inference. It would require experts to learn not just their specialty but also how to interpret and build upon outputs from other specific experts.

Are you thinking about this in the context of improving consistency in multi-turn conversations, or perhaps for better interpretability of MoE models?

## [6/9] Reasoning Models and Modular Architecture

# Reasoning Models and Modular Architecture Discussion

*Date: August 10, 2025*

## Conversation

**Human**: I just had a thought about "reasoning" models. A typical, quick description would be that there is a model that after a query, we give the opportunity to produce intermediate output in the normal way, and then to make use of that intermediate output along with the original query to form the final output. The model having been trained in how to make use of that option. Would you agree on the characterization?

**Assistant**: I think that's a reasonable high-level characterization, though I'd refine it slightly. The key elements you've identified are spot-on:

- **Intermediate output generation** - The model produces some form of "thinking" or reasoning steps before the final answer
- **Sequential processing** - The final output can leverage both the original query and the intermediate work
- **Trained behavior** - The model has learned (through training) how to effectively use this intermediate space

Where I might adjust the description is in emphasizing that this intermediate output is typically treated differently from the final output during training. Often these "reasoning traces" or "chain-of-thought" outputs are trained to be more exploratory, verbose, and focused on working through the problem systematically - almost like scratch work - while the final output is trained to be polished and direct.

Also, while you described it as giving the model "the opportunity" to produce intermediate output, in many implementations it's more that the model is specifically trained to always produce this reasoning phase first (though the user might not see it), rather than it being optional.

But yes, fundamentally you've captured the core idea: it's about creating a structured two-phase approach where the model can "think out loud" before answering, and training it to use that thinking space effectively.

**Human**: Thanks. I would accept your clarifications. Suppose we try to mix the general idea here with the general idea behind mixture of experts architectures. Is there any reason that the model producing the intermediate output and the model producing the final output need to be the same? Is there any reason to limit this to two models? Could this be allowed to be a bidirectional "internal conversation" between models? Is this already being done or investigated?

**Assistant**: You're onto something really interesting here! There's no fundamental reason why the "reasoning" and "final output" phases need to be handled by the same model - in fact, separating them could have some compelling advantages.

Your idea maps naturally onto several existing and emerging approaches:

**Multi-agent systems** - There's already work on having multiple LLMs collaborate through conversation. Papers like "Debating Networks" and more recent work on multi-agent debate show that models can refine answers through discussion. The key insight is that different models (or even the same model in different "roles") can catch different errors and contribute different strengths.

**Specialized expert models** - You could imagine having a "reasoning specialist" that's particularly good at breaking down problems, a "verification specialist" that checks logic, and a "communication specialist" that formulates the final user-facing response. This would be like mixture-of-experts but at a higher, more semantic level rather than at the token/layer level.

**Bidirectional internal conversation** - This is particularly intriguing. Instead of a one-way pipeline (reasoning → output), you could have iterative refinement where the "output model" might ask clarifying questions back to the "reasoning model," or where multiple specialists negotiate toward a consensus.

The challenges I see are mainly practical: latency (multiple model calls add up), training complexity (how do you train models to work well together?), and coordination (when does the conversation stop?). But none of these seem insurmountable.

Are you imagining something like a modular cognitive architecture where different specialized models handle different aspects of reasoning, similar to how different brain regions specialize but communicate?

**Human**: Yes, exactly. Both for the purposes of possibly creating more capable models, but also for interpretability. Even if you imagine a model (macro model?) implemented this way which was no more capable than a monolithic model, being able to see the communication between the modules would make it much more interpretable.

**Assistant**: That's a brilliant insight about interpretability! You're right - even with equivalent capability, the architectural transparency could be game-changing.

The interpretability benefits would be substantial:

**Explicit information flow** - Instead of trying to probe internal activations or attention patterns in a monolithic model, you'd have natural language (or at least symbolic) communication between modules that you can directly observe. It's like having built-in "thoughts" that are actually meant to be interpretable rather than post-hoc interpretations of neural activations.

**Failure diagnosis** - When something goes wrong, you could trace exactly where in the "conversation" things broke down. Did the reasoning module misunderstand the problem? Did the verification module miss a logical error? Did the communication module misrepresent the conclusion?

**Modular verification** - You could potentially verify or even formally specify the behavior of individual modules more easily than a monolithic system. Each module has a clearer, more bounded role.

**Targeted improvements** - If you identify that certain types of errors come from specific modules, you could retrain or replace just those components without touching the rest of the system.

This reminds me of the old AI dream of "society of mind" architectures, but now actually feasible with powerful language models as the components. The overhead of natural language communication between modules (versus tensor passing in a monolithic model) might be worth it for the interpretability gains alone, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding the reasoning process is crucial.

Have you thought about what the optimal granularity would be? Too fine-grained and you lose efficiency, too coarse and you lose the interpretability benefits.

**Human**: Recent progress, and how it has unfolded, makes me think it would be best if, somehow --- and I don't currently have any ideas, the optimal granularity was found as part of training. Maybe even the language of communication.

**Assistant**: That's a fascinating direction - letting the architecture discover its own modularity and communication protocols through training. You're essentially describing emergent specialization and possibly even emergent "languages" between components.

This connects to some deep ideas:

**Emergent communication protocols** - Rather than forcing modules to communicate in natural language (which might be inefficient), you could let them develop their own compressed representations. The challenge is balancing this with interpretability - perhaps you'd want some regularization that keeps the communication "human-interpretable enough" while still allowing efficiency gains.

**Dynamic architecture search** - The system could learn when to spawn new "experts," when to merge them, and how to route between them. This is like neural architecture search but at a much higher semantic level. The granularity would emerge from the task demands rather than being pre-specified.

**Differentiable routing** - You'd need some way to make the whole system end-to-end trainable despite the discrete decisions about which modules to invoke. This might look like soft routing initially that gradually becomes more discrete, similar to how some mixture-of-experts models work.

The really intriguing possibility is that such a system might discover modularizations that don't map cleanly onto our human concepts of "reasoning," "verification," etc. Instead, it might find some other factorization of intelligence that's more natural from an information-processing perspective but alien to our intuitions.

The lack of current ideas for how to implement this might actually be telling us something important - perhaps our current training paradigms (supervised learning on input-output pairs) aren't rich enough to discover this kind of structure. You might need something more like evolutionary approaches or meta-learning objectives that explicitly reward modularity and interpretability.

**Human**: Is this somewhat like an extension of tool use?

**Assistant**: Yes, absolutely! That's a really insightful connection. Tool use is already teaching models to decompose problems into discrete, interpretable steps with explicit intermediate outputs.

The progression might look like:
- **Current tool use**: Model decides to call calculator, web search, code interpreter
- **Your vision**: Model decides to call "reasoning module," "verification module," "synthesis module" - where these "tools" are themselves models

The key similarities:
- **Explicit dispatch decisions** - Just as models learn when to use a calculator vs. web search, they'd learn when to invoke different cognitive modules
- **Standardized interfaces** - Tools require formatted inputs/outputs; internal modules would need communication protocols
- **Observable intermediate steps** - We can see when a model calls a tool and what it returns; same would apply to module communication

The fascinating extension is that unlike current tools which are mostly deterministic and narrow (calculator always does arithmetic the same way), these model-based "tools" could be:
- **Learnable** - The tools themselves improve through training
- **Negotiable** - They could engage in back-and-forth rather than just request/response
- **Emergent** - The system could potentially spawn new specialized tools as needed

In some sense, you're describing a model that can grow its own cognitive toolkit, where each tool is a specialized neural module, and the communication between tools becomes part of the observable reasoning trace. It's like tool use turned inward - tools for thought rather than tools for external interaction.

## User

This question is inspired by hearing someone else ask Dwarkesh what we really mean when we distinguish reasoning from non-reasoning models. If I think of the sequence of states involved when a reasoning model responds to a query, that is a sequence of states where each state is defined as a set of activations, data in a scratch pad, and data in a context window. Would you agree so far?

## Claude

 Yes, I think that's a reasonable way to characterize the sequence of states, though I'd suggest a small refinement to make it more precise.

For a reasoning model processing a query, each state in the sequence could indeed be characterized by:

1. **Activations** - The neural network's internal representations/hidden states at that point in processing
2. **Scratch pad data** - Any intermediate computations, working memory, or chain-of-thought reasoning that's been explicitly generated
3. **Context window data** - The accumulated tokens/information available to the model at that step

The refinement I'd suggest is clarifying what we mean by "scratch pad" - in many current reasoning models, this is actually just part of the context window where the model writes out its reasoning steps. So you might have:
- The original query
- Any reasoning tokens generated so far
- Any other contextual information

All sitting together in the context window, rather than a truly separate scratch pad memory system.

But yes, conceptually your framing captures the key idea - at each step in processing, the model's state consists of both its internal neural activations and the external/explicit information it has access to and has generated. This provides a concrete way to think about the computational trajectory from query to response.

## User

OK, let's go with your refinement. If we leave practicality aside, could there be mappings which makes that equivalent to some larger network without the "reasoning"? E.g. extra layers being equivalent in some way to the state of the reasoning models which is outside of the activations?

## Claude

 Yes, absolutely! This is a fascinating theoretical question that touches on some deep ideas in computational theory.

In principle, you could imagine "unrolling" or "compiling" a reasoning process into a much larger feedforward network. Here's how this might work:

1. **Temporal unrolling**: Each step of reasoning could correspond to a set of layers in the larger network. So if a reasoning model takes N steps, you might have N groups of layers, each processing the equivalent of one reasoning step.

2. **Scratch pad encoding**: The information that would be written to the context window during reasoning could instead be encoded in the activation patterns between these layer groups. What was explicit text becomes implicit distributed representations.

3. **Conditional computation**: The larger network would need to handle all possible reasoning paths, essentially building in the computation for every possible intermediate thought the reasoning model might generate.

The key insight is that anything computed iteratively can, in principle, be computed by a sufficiently large feedforward network. This is related to why RNNs can be "unrolled" into feedforward networks for fixed sequence lengths.

However, this would likely require an exponentially larger network because:
- You'd need to account for all possible reasoning trajectories
- The network would have to implicitly learn to route information through the right "reasoning paths"
- You lose the efficiency of reusing the same parameters across reasoning steps

So while theoretically possible, it suggests that reasoning models might be a much more parameter-efficient way to achieve certain capabilities - they're essentially using iteration and external memory to avoid needing astronomical numbers of parameters.

## User

What do you think would result if we trained a base model "backwards", predicting the previous word in texts, training on a corpus in the reverse direction?

## Claude

 Training a language model to predict previous tokens instead of next tokens is an intriguing idea that would likely produce some interesting results:

**What would probably work similarly:**
- The model would still learn rich representations of language structure, grammar, and semantics
- It would capture statistical dependencies between words and phrases
- The internal representations would likely be similarly useful for downstream tasks

**Key differences we might see:**

1. **Asymmetric reasoning patterns**: Natural language has inherent directional biases. For example, causes typically precede effects in text, subjects precede predicates, and questions precede answers. A reverse-trained model might develop different inductive biases about these relationships.

2. **Different attention mechanisms**: In forward prediction, models often need to maintain long-range dependencies (like keeping track of a subject mentioned paragraphs ago). Backward prediction might emphasize different types of dependencies - perhaps focusing more on how conclusions relate to their premises.

3. **Altered generation behavior**: If you used such a model for generation (running it in reverse), it might tend to start with conclusions or outcomes and work backward to premises or setups. This could be useful for certain tasks like story outline generation or reverse-engineering explanations.

4. **Potential complementary strengths**: The backward model might excel at different tasks - perhaps better at answering "why" questions or identifying presuppositions in text.

In practice, this approach has been explored in computer vision (with bidirectional models) and some NLP applications. The most powerful approach might be training models that can process text in both directions, capturing the unique patterns available from each perspective.

## User

You and I have had several discussions helping me understand transformers. More than just the architecture and algorithms, but also trying to puzzle out how and why they work. I.e. how does the architecture lead to intelligence. One particular thing I have wondered about and we've discussed is ripe for considering again in light of recent releases of CoT models a.k.a. extended thinking. I have wondered what the natural language for LLM thinking was or perhaps what were the "units of thought". My intuition was that it is more natural to think of the sequence of tokens in the embedding space than the tokens in the target language. Before CoT, I wondered if it would be better to allow an LLM to think / generate a response by  creating a sequence of next vectors repeatedly rather than next tokens. I.e. skipping the step of choosing a token from the target language randomly. Then, somehow, translate the whole generated sequence into the target language. Now I am very curious about what might be a slightly easier application of this idea: doing this for the "thinking space" in CoT / extended thinking, and not even worrying about translating to the target output language.

## Claude


The user and I have had discussions about transformers, their architecture, and how they lead to intelligence. The user is now bringing up a fascinating theoretical question related to "extended thinking" or Chain of Thought (CoT) models. Let me break down what they're asking:

1. They've wondered what the "natural language" for LLM thinking is - i.e., what are the fundamental "units of thought" in these models.

2. Their intuition is that thinking more directly in the embedding space (vectors) might be more "natural" for LLMs than thinking in tokens of the target language.

3. They're questioning whether it would be more efficient for an LLM to generate sequences of vectors directly in the embedding space, rather than repeatedly sampling tokens from the probability distribution.

4. Now with the release of explicit CoT/extended thinking models, they're wondering if this approach might be particularly useful for the "thinking" phase, without necessarily needing to translate this vector-space thinking into natural language.

This is a really interesting theoretical question about the nature of computation and representation in large language models. Let me organize my thoughts about this.

First, to recap what the user is referring to about CoT/extended thinking models: These are models that have been explicitly trained to show their reasoning process (either through fine-tuning or RLHF) before giving a final answer. The idea is that by explicitly working through a problem step by step in natural language, the model produces more accurate answers.

The user is suggesting that perhaps the "thinking" part might be more efficiently done directly in the embedding space, without translating to natural language tokens. This is an intriguing hypothesis.

Some considerations:

1. **Continuous vs. Discrete Representations**: LLMs operate by moving between continuous vector spaces (embeddings) and discrete tokens. The user is suggesting that perhaps staying in the continuous space longer before discretizing might be beneficial.

2. **Loss of Information**: Every time we sample a token from the probability distribution, we lose information. The full distribution contains more information than just the token we sample. So in theory, operating directly on vectors could preserve more information.

3. **Computational Challenges**: Generating and manipulating sequences of high-dimensional vectors has its own computational challenges. The token space provides a compressed, discrete representation that might be more computationally efficient in some ways.

4. **Interpretability**: One benefit of CoT is that the thinking process is interpretable to humans. If the thinking happened entirely in embedding space, we'd lose that interpretability.

5. **Training Challenges**: Current models are trained to predict the next token given previous tokens. Training a model to predict the next embedding vector directly would require significant architectural changes.

6. **Research Directions**: Some research in this direction includes:
   - Vector quantization techniques like VQVAE
   - Continuous transformers or models that operate directly on continuous representations
   - Latent diffusion models that generate in a latent space before decoding

I think the user is touching on something profound about representation and computation. In a way, they're asking: is the token-by-token generation process a limitation imposed by our training methods, or is it somehow fundamental to how these models should work?

I'll respond thoughtfully to this fascinating theoretical question, acknowledging the depth of the inquiry and offering some perspectives on how direct vector-space computation might indeed be an interesting direction for the "thinking" phase of CoT models.

You've raised a fascinating question about the fundamental nature of computation in LLMs, particularly regarding CoT/extended thinking models. I've been pondering this concept as well.

The idea of allowing models to "think" directly in the embedding space rather than generating discrete tokens is compelling for several reasons:

1. When we sample tokens from probability distributions, we lose information at each step. The full distribution contains nuance and uncertainty that gets discarded.

2. Embedding vectors capture semantic relationships that might be more "natural" for computation than the discrete jumps between tokens.

3. For reasoning tasks especially, maintaining the continuity of thought in vector space could potentially prevent some of the discretization errors that accumulate when forcing thoughts into token-by-token generation.

For CoT specifically, this approach is intriguing because the "thinking" phase doesn't necessarily need human interpretability during execution - only the final output does. So the model could potentially:

1. Perform reasoning in continuous vector space
2. Only discretize into tokens when presenting the final answer

The challenges would be significant though. Current architectures are fundamentally designed around predicting discrete tokens, and the computational costs of manipulating sequences of high-dimensional vectors directly would be substantial.

Some research that touches on related concepts includes work on continuous transformers, latent diffusion models, and vector quantization techniques - though none tackle exactly what you're proposing.

What specifically interests you most about this approach to extended thinking? The theoretical elegance, potential performance improvements, or something else?
