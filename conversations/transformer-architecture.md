# Transformer Architecture Conversations

[← Back to Conversations Index](/conversations/)

## Overview

Deep technical discussions about transformer models, attention mechanisms, tokenization, and architectural innovations. These conversations explore both theoretical foundations and practical implementations of transformer-based systems.

## Topics Covered

- Multi-token planning mechanisms
- Information flow in transformer architectures
- Attention mechanism mathematics and intuition
- Tokenization strategies and embeddings
- Context window management
- Decoder architectures and continuous representations
- Vector-space thinking for reasoning models
