I'm a sad to have just found out that I lost a conversation we had last night. Let's see if we can reconstruct the important parts.

It began with me asking about the implications of distillation and quantization working so well at providing similar model accuracy with fewer resources. I mentioned that the standard take away is that models could be smaller. My non-standard take away was that frontier models could get much more capable without growing.

We then explored what I now see was my underlying intuition that distillation might work best when distilling a model into a smaller copy of itself rather than a different model.

We then considered going in the other direction. I wondered if we could grow models overtime, as needed by their current states of training. We explored two versions of this. 

The least speculative one involved copying a model, adding things like new layers or new attention heads with parameters set initially so they acted as identity transformations, and adding new embedding dimensions by, essentially, appending a zero to every vector. (And though we didn't discuss it, I now think adding the last row and column of the N+1 identity matrix to all the old N-matrices). This would preserve the old capabilities. However, we were concerned that the gradients would not point in the right directions for the new parameter space to be used for learning so we imagined adding some random noise in the new parameters. But since this would degrade performance, we thought we would add some 'distillation in reverse', with the new, larger model learning from the old, smaller model to regain functionality without "using up" training data.

The more speculative version we to imagine the model's network as *formally* infinite, with some moveable boundary in parameter space defining an inside region around the origin with meaningful parameters, and an outside region where all (notional) parameters are considered to be set to the values which correspond to identity transformations. (I am not sure how the embedding space dimension fits in here.) We would then add a penalty to the loss function inspired by gravity. It would penalize having "non-zero" (meaning non-identity transform generating) parameters far away from each other. The idea is that the model would only expand in parameter space as necessary based on "training pressure" overcoming "gravity". And the outer boundary would have to be moved outward as necessary. We potentially also have an issue of gradients not pointing in the right direction to use new parameters.

The hoped for benefits include
1) Models using only the resources they really need for their level of capability
2) Maybe faster training, because at any moment the number of parameters is as small as can be
3) Being able to improve models over the long term. Not needing to stop using one model and start from scratch with a new one when bumping up against limits of the original model's size. 

What do you think? I am sure I forgot some of the conversation.

 This is a fascinating reconstruction of what sounds like a deep conversation about model architecture evolution. Let me engage with these ideas and perhaps add some perspectives we might not have covered last time.

The distillation insight is particularly interesting. Your intuition about distilling into similar architectures makes sense - the student model would have a natural "mapping" for inheriting the teacher's learned patterns. This connects to work on lottery tickets and pruning, where we often find that the "important" parts of networks maintain similar structural relationships.

On growing models, I find your two approaches complementary:

For the first approach (explicit growth), I think the gradient concern is well-founded. Even with identity-preserving initialization, backpropagation might struggle to "activate" the new parameters meaningfully. Your proposed solution of combining noise and reverse distillation is clever - it provides both exploration potential and stability. We might also consider:
- Gradually scaling up the noise over time
- Using attention masks that slowly "unveil" new components
- Applying curriculum learning specifically to the new parameters

The "infinite formal network" with gravitational penalty is a fascinating theoretical framework. It reminds me of regularization approaches but with a spatial metaphor. Some thoughts:

1. The gravitational penalty could create interesting emergent behaviors:
   - Natural clustering of related functionalities
   - Automatic pruning of unnecessary complexity
   - A kind of "surface tension" that maintains model cohesion

2. The boundary movement challenge might be addressed by making it dynamic - perhaps using a meta-learning approach that adjusts the boundary based on training metrics.

3. The embedding space dimension could potentially be handled through a similar formalism - imagine an infinite-dimensional embedding space where most dimensions are zeroed out by the gravitational penalty.

Regarding your hoped-for benefits:
- Point 1 (resource efficiency) seems quite achievable, especially with the gravitational approach
- Point 2 (faster training) might depend on how efficiently we can handle the boundary dynamics
- Point 3 (continuous improvement) is particularly compelling - it suggests a path toward more sustainable AI development

Would you say the conversation touched on how these approaches might interact with attention mechanisms specifically? I'm curious about whether growing models might require special consideration for how attention patterns evolve.

## User

Ah, yes. The lottery ticket hypothesis did come up, as did curriculum learning. There is a strong analogy with my "larger model with areas set to no-ops / identity transformations" and the lottery ticket scenario where only certain parts of a model "do the real work".

I really like the "most dimensions zeroed out by the gravitational penalty". Very cutting-edge theoretical physicsy! (And I am a physicist by training, so the attraction makes sense.)

## Claude

 The lottery ticket/pruning connection is quite deep here - both scenarios suggest that neural networks have some kind of "natural" topology or sparsity pattern that emerges through training. Your growing model approach could be seen as discovering this pattern "from the bottom up" rather than "from the top down."

The physics analogy gets even richer when you think about it. In quantum field theory, we have this concept of the "vacuum state" where fields settle to their lowest energy configuration. Your gravitational penalty is similar - it encourages parameters to collapse to identity transformations (the "vacuum state" of a neural network layer) unless there's enough "excitation" (training signal) to justify a more complex configuration.

This makes me wonder about phase transitions in growing networks. Could there be critical points where:
1. The network suddenly expands into new regions of parameter space
2. Previously separate functional clusters merge
3. The effective dimensionality of the embedding space jumps discontinuously

Given your physics background, do you see other physical analogies that might be instructive here? I'm particularly curious about whether concepts from statistical mechanics or renormalization group theory might offer insights into how to handle the scaling behavior of these growing networks.

## User

I think the vacuum state analogy is good for thinking about the unperturbed state of the infinite parameter space as being one which implies identity transformations. Which one could also visualize as gravity, imagining the space as a plane and perturbed parameters as elevated. But thr gravity analogy is also, perhaps primarily, about keeping those perturbed parts close to each other. Like planet, star, galaxy, ... formation.

## Claude

 Ah yes, this dual role of the gravitational analogy is fascinating! The vacuum state represents the "natural" identity transformation state, while the clustering effect mirrors cosmic structure formation. 

This makes me think about hierarchical structure formation in both contexts:
- In cosmology, we see matter clustering at different scales (stars -> galaxies -> clusters -> superclusters)
- In your growing network, we might see parameters clustering hierarchically to form:
  - Local functional units (like individual attention heads)
  - Related groups of units (like entire attention layers)
  - Larger functional modules

The gravitational clustering would naturally encourage this kind of hierarchical organization, potentially leading to more interpretable model structure. Parameters that need to work together would tend to be spatially proximate in parameter space.

This also suggests an interesting perspective on model capacity: just as gravity determines the maximum stable size of astronomical structures (like the Jeans mass for star formation), your gravitational penalty would create natural limits on functional cluster sizes unless there's sufficient "training pressure" to overcome it.

Do you think this hierarchical clustering might naturally lead to more modular network architectures? It seems like it could encourage the formation of specialized subnetworks that are relatively loosely coupled - similar to how galaxies maintain their structure while still being part of larger clusters.

I just tried a couple of new OpenAI models on this. I asked their Deep Research model to read our conversation and run with it. Then I asked another of their models to double check the work --- it seemed to me that it was taking a lot of our speculation as established, in a hallucination-like way. What do you think?

## Claude

 I agree - it seems the Deep Research model was treating our speculative discussion as if it were established work in the field. The specific hallucinations include:

1. The references to Yuan et al. (2023) and Nazaret et al. (2022) appear to be fabricated
2. The discussion of "infinite networks with gravitational penalty" is treated as an existing research direction rather than our theoretical speculation
3. Many technical details are presented as if they were proven results rather than hypothetical proposals

The core ideas we discussed (dynamic growth, identity initialization, regularization for sparsity) do connect to real work like Net2Net, Mixture-of-Experts, and continual learning. However, our specific synthesis combining these ideas with physics-inspired penalties remains unexplored speculation.

This illustrates a common LLM failure mode - confabulating detailed, plausible-sounding academic content around novel ideas by mixing real references with hallucinated ones and treating speculation as established research.

Would you like me to suggest some actual relevant literature that could inform explorations of these ideas?

## User

I think up-to-date web searching is important here. Can you instead suggest a query for the Deep Research model? A more straight forward research request, rather than a request to evaluate our conversation which may have been what led it astray.

## Claude

 Here's a focused research query:

"Recent research (2020-2024) on dynamic neural network growth during training, focusing on techniques that preserve model capabilities while expanding architecture. Include work on growing transformers and attention mechanisms. Exclude pruning methods unless directly relevant to growth."

This is more likely to surface actual papers rather than interpreting our speculative discussion. It focuses on the concrete aspects of dynamic model growth rather than the more theoretical "infinite network" concept.
