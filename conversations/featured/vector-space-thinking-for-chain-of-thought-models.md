## User

You and I have had several discussions helping me understand transformers. More than just the architecture and algorithms, but also trying to puzzle out how and why they work. I.e. how does the architecture lead to intelligence. One particular thing I have wondered about and we've discussed is ripe for considering again in light of recent releases of CoT models a.k.a. extended thinking. I have wondered what the natural language for LLM thinking was or perhaps what were the "units of thought". My intuition was that it is more natural to think of the sequence of tokens in the embedding space than the tokens in the target language. Before CoT, I wondered if it would be better to allow an LLM to think / generate a response by  creating a sequence of next vectors repeatedly rather than next tokens. I.e. skipping the step of choosing a token from the target language randomly. Then, somehow, translate the whole generated sequence into the target language. Now I am very curious about what might be a slightly easier application of this idea: doing this for the "thinking space" in CoT / extended thinking, and not even worrying about translating to the target output language.

The user and I have had discussions about transformers, their architecture, and how they lead to intelligence. The user is now bringing up a fascinating theoretical question related to "extended thinking" or Chain of Thought (CoT) models. Let me break down what they're asking:

1. They've wondered what the "natural language" for LLM thinking is - i.e., what are the fundamental "units of thought" in these models.

2. Their intuition is that thinking more directly in the embedding space (vectors) might be more "natural" for LLMs than thinking in tokens of the target language.

3. They're questioning whether it would be more efficient for an LLM to generate sequences of vectors directly in the embedding space, rather than repeatedly sampling tokens from the probability distribution.

4. Now with the release of explicit CoT/extended thinking models, they're wondering if this approach might be particularly useful for the "thinking" phase, without necessarily needing to translate this vector-space thinking into natural language.

This is a really interesting theoretical question about the nature of computation and representation in large language models. Let me organize my thoughts about this.

First, to recap what the user is referring to about CoT/extended thinking models: These are models that have been explicitly trained to show their reasoning process (either through fine-tuning or RLHF) before giving a final answer. The idea is that by explicitly working through a problem step by step in natural language, the model produces more accurate answers.

The user is suggesting that perhaps the "thinking" part might be more efficiently done directly in the embedding space, without translating to natural language tokens. This is an intriguing hypothesis.

Some considerations:

1. **Continuous vs. Discrete Representations**: LLMs operate by moving between continuous vector spaces (embeddings) and discrete tokens. The user is suggesting that perhaps staying in the continuous space longer before discretizing might be beneficial.

2. **Loss of Information**: Every time we sample a token from the probability distribution, we lose information. The full distribution contains more information than just the token we sample. So in theory, operating directly on vectors could preserve more information.

3. **Computational Challenges**: Generating and manipulating sequences of high-dimensional vectors has its own computational challenges. The token space provides a compressed, discrete representation that might be more computationally efficient in some ways.

4. **Interpretability**: One benefit of CoT is that the thinking process is interpretable to humans. If the thinking happened entirely in embedding space, we'd lose that interpretability.

5. **Training Challenges**: Current models are trained to predict the next token given previous tokens. Training a model to predict the next embedding vector directly would require significant architectural changes.

6. **Research Directions**: Some research in this direction includes:
   - Vector quantization techniques like VQVAE
   - Continuous transformers or models that operate directly on continuous representations
   - Latent diffusion models that generate in a latent space before decoding

I think the user is touching on something profound about representation and computation. In a way, they're asking: is the token-by-token generation process a limitation imposed by our training methods, or is it somehow fundamental to how these models should work?

I'll respond thoughtfully to this fascinating theoretical question, acknowledging the depth of the inquiry and offering some perspectives on how direct vector-space computation might indeed be an interesting direction for the "thinking" phase of CoT models.

You've raised a fascinating question about the fundamental nature of computation in LLMs, particularly regarding CoT/extended thinking models. I've been pondering this concept as well.

The idea of allowing models to "think" directly in the embedding space rather than generating discrete tokens is compelling for several reasons:

1. When we sample tokens from probability distributions, we lose information at each step. The full distribution contains nuance and uncertainty that gets discarded.

2. Embedding vectors capture semantic relationships that might be more "natural" for computation than the discrete jumps between tokens.

3. For reasoning tasks especially, maintaining the continuity of thought in vector space could potentially prevent some of the discretization errors that accumulate when forcing thoughts into token-by-token generation.

For CoT specifically, this approach is intriguing because the "thinking" phase doesn't necessarily need human interpretability during execution - only the final output does. So the model could potentially:

1. Perform reasoning in continuous vector space
2. Only discretize into tokens when presenting the final answer

The challenges would be significant though. Current architectures are fundamentally designed around predicting discrete tokens, and the computational costs of manipulating sequences of high-dimensional vectors directly would be substantial.

Some research that touches on related concepts includes work on continuous transformers, latent diffusion models, and vector quantization techniques - though none tackle exactly what you're proposing.

What specifically interests you most about this approach to extended thinking? The theoretical elegance, potential performance improvements, or something else?
