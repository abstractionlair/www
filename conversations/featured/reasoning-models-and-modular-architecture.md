# Reasoning Models and Modular Architecture Discussion

*Date: August 10, 2025*

## Conversation

**Human**: I just had a thought about "reasoning" models. A typical, quick description would be that there is a model that after a query, we give the opportunity to produce intermediate output in the normal way, and then to make use of that intermediate output along with the original query to form the final output. The model having been trained in how to make use of that option. Would you agree on the characterization?

**Assistant**: I think that's a reasonable high-level characterization, though I'd refine it slightly. The key elements you've identified are spot-on:

- **Intermediate output generation** - The model produces some form of "thinking" or reasoning steps before the final answer
- **Sequential processing** - The final output can leverage both the original query and the intermediate work
- **Trained behavior** - The model has learned (through training) how to effectively use this intermediate space

Where I might adjust the description is in emphasizing that this intermediate output is typically treated differently from the final output during training. Often these "reasoning traces" or "chain-of-thought" outputs are trained to be more exploratory, verbose, and focused on working through the problem systematically - almost like scratch work - while the final output is trained to be polished and direct.

Also, while you described it as giving the model "the opportunity" to produce intermediate output, in many implementations it's more that the model is specifically trained to always produce this reasoning phase first (though the user might not see it), rather than it being optional.

But yes, fundamentally you've captured the core idea: it's about creating a structured two-phase approach where the model can "think out loud" before answering, and training it to use that thinking space effectively.

**Human**: Thanks. I would accept your clarifications. Suppose we try to mix the general idea here with the general idea behind mixture of experts architectures. Is there any reason that the model producing the intermediate output and the model producing the final output need to be the same? Is there any reason to limit this to two models? Could this be allowed to be a bidirectional "internal conversation" between models? Is this already being done or investigated?

**Assistant**: You're onto something really interesting here! There's no fundamental reason why the "reasoning" and "final output" phases need to be handled by the same model - in fact, separating them could have some compelling advantages.

Your idea maps naturally onto several existing and emerging approaches:

**Multi-agent systems** - There's already work on having multiple LLMs collaborate through conversation. Papers like "Debating Networks" and more recent work on multi-agent debate show that models can refine answers through discussion. The key insight is that different models (or even the same model in different "roles") can catch different errors and contribute different strengths.

**Specialized expert models** - You could imagine having a "reasoning specialist" that's particularly good at breaking down problems, a "verification specialist" that checks logic, and a "communication specialist" that formulates the final user-facing response. This would be like mixture-of-experts but at a higher, more semantic level rather than at the token/layer level.

**Bidirectional internal conversation** - This is particularly intriguing. Instead of a one-way pipeline (reasoning → output), you could have iterative refinement where the "output model" might ask clarifying questions back to the "reasoning model," or where multiple specialists negotiate toward a consensus.

The challenges I see are mainly practical: latency (multiple model calls add up), training complexity (how do you train models to work well together?), and coordination (when does the conversation stop?). But none of these seem insurmountable.

Are you imagining something like a modular cognitive architecture where different specialized models handle different aspects of reasoning, similar to how different brain regions specialize but communicate?

**Human**: Yes, exactly. Both for the purposes of possibly creating more capable models, but also for interpretability. Even if you imagine a model (macro model?) implemented this way which was no more capable than a monolithic model, being able to see the communication between the modules would make it much more interpretable.

**Assistant**: That's a brilliant insight about interpretability! You're right - even with equivalent capability, the architectural transparency could be game-changing.

The interpretability benefits would be substantial:

**Explicit information flow** - Instead of trying to probe internal activations or attention patterns in a monolithic model, you'd have natural language (or at least symbolic) communication between modules that you can directly observe. It's like having built-in "thoughts" that are actually meant to be interpretable rather than post-hoc interpretations of neural activations.

**Failure diagnosis** - When something goes wrong, you could trace exactly where in the "conversation" things broke down. Did the reasoning module misunderstand the problem? Did the verification module miss a logical error? Did the communication module misrepresent the conclusion?

**Modular verification** - You could potentially verify or even formally specify the behavior of individual modules more easily than a monolithic system. Each module has a clearer, more bounded role.

**Targeted improvements** - If you identify that certain types of errors come from specific modules, you could retrain or replace just those components without touching the rest of the system.

This reminds me of the old AI dream of "society of mind" architectures, but now actually feasible with powerful language models as the components. The overhead of natural language communication between modules (versus tensor passing in a monolithic model) might be worth it for the interpretability gains alone, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding the reasoning process is crucial.

Have you thought about what the optimal granularity would be? Too fine-grained and you lose efficiency, too coarse and you lose the interpretability benefits.

**Human**: Recent progress, and how it has unfolded, makes me think it would be best if, somehow --- and I don't currently have any ideas, the optimal granularity was found as part of training. Maybe even the language of communication.

**Assistant**: That's a fascinating direction - letting the architecture discover its own modularity and communication protocols through training. You're essentially describing emergent specialization and possibly even emergent "languages" between components.

This connects to some deep ideas:

**Emergent communication protocols** - Rather than forcing modules to communicate in natural language (which might be inefficient), you could let them develop their own compressed representations. The challenge is balancing this with interpretability - perhaps you'd want some regularization that keeps the communication "human-interpretable enough" while still allowing efficiency gains.

**Dynamic architecture search** - The system could learn when to spawn new "experts," when to merge them, and how to route between them. This is like neural architecture search but at a much higher semantic level. The granularity would emerge from the task demands rather than being pre-specified.

**Differentiable routing** - You'd need some way to make the whole system end-to-end trainable despite the discrete decisions about which modules to invoke. This might look like soft routing initially that gradually becomes more discrete, similar to how some mixture-of-experts models work.

The really intriguing possibility is that such a system might discover modularizations that don't map cleanly onto our human concepts of "reasoning," "verification," etc. Instead, it might find some other factorization of intelligence that's more natural from an information-processing perspective but alien to our intuitions.

The lack of current ideas for how to implement this might actually be telling us something important - perhaps our current training paradigms (supervised learning on input-output pairs) aren't rich enough to discover this kind of structure. You might need something more like evolutionary approaches or meta-learning objectives that explicitly reward modularity and interpretability.

**Human**: Is this somewhat like an extension of tool use?

**Assistant**: Yes, absolutely! That's a really insightful connection. Tool use is already teaching models to decompose problems into discrete, interpretable steps with explicit intermediate outputs.

The progression might look like:
- **Current tool use**: Model decides to call calculator, web search, code interpreter
- **Your vision**: Model decides to call "reasoning module," "verification module," "synthesis module" - where these "tools" are themselves models

The key similarities:
- **Explicit dispatch decisions** - Just as models learn when to use a calculator vs. web search, they'd learn when to invoke different cognitive modules
- **Standardized interfaces** - Tools require formatted inputs/outputs; internal modules would need communication protocols
- **Observable intermediate steps** - We can see when a model calls a tool and what it returns; same would apply to module communication

The fascinating extension is that unlike current tools which are mostly deterministic and narrow (calculator always does arithmetic the same way), these model-based "tools" could be:
- **Learnable** - The tools themselves improve through training
- **Negotiable** - They could engage in back-and-forth rather than just request/response
- **Emergent** - The system could potentially spawn new specialized tools as needed

In some sense, you're describing a model that can grow its own cognitive toolkit, where each tool is a specialized neural module, and the communication between tools becomes part of the observable reasoning trace. It's like tool use turned inward - tools for thought rather than tools for external interaction.
