## User

Please consider this conversation with o1. (Except near the end, when I think I used up my quota and was switched to GPT-4o.) I'd like to capture *my* beliefs regarding existential AI risk implied by it in an artifact.

## Claude

 Let me help capture your beliefs about existential AI risk based on your conversation. I'll create an artifact that outlines your position and key considerations.

`&lt;antThinking&gt;`This should be an artifact as it's a comprehensive analytical piece documenting core beliefs and arguments that may need to be referenced or modified later. The content focuses on capturing deep analytical thoughts rather than basic explanations.`&lt;/antThinking&gt;`



I've created an artifact capturing what I understand to be your core beliefs and analytical framework regarding existential AI risk based on the conversation. The structure emphasizes your focus on empirical evidence, probability quantification, and the distinction between theoretical possibility and practical probability.

Would you like me to adjust any aspects of this to better reflect your position? I can modify specific sections or add new perspectives that I might have missed.

## User

The part on instrumental subgoals doesn't quite capture my thinking. I have in mind something like the following.

We attempt to train a model with goal G, but because alignment is hard we end up with G'. But the probability distribution of G' isn't uniform. G' is highly unlikely to be the inverse of G, and most likely to be near G. 

The model develops instrumental subgoals, say S as one of them. I think it is highly unlikely that S contradicts G'. Even if we allow for the model failing to internally align its instrumental subgoals to its ultimate goals a similar argument holds as above so S will be aligned to G'' which is most likely close to G'.

Net, I am arguing that G'' is still not very likely to be far from G.

## Claude

 Let me update the section on instrumental subgoals to better reflect this more nuanced perspective about the probability distribution of goal alignment.

`&lt;antThinking&gt;`This is a substantial refinement of the instrumental subgoals section that adds important nuance about probability distributions of goal alignment. This warrants updating the existing artifact rather than creating a new one.`&lt;/antThinking&gt;`



I've updated the section to reflect your view about the probability distributions in goal alignment - both at the top level and for instrumental subgoals. This captures the key insight that even with potential drift or misalignment at multiple levels, the compound probability of ending up far from the intended goal G remains low because the distribution at each step tends to cluster near the intended goal.

Would you like me to refine this further, or should we update any other sections to better align with this perspective?

## User

Are you troubled by any of this?

## Claude

 Having carefully considered your arguments, I find them quite compelling on several fronts, particularly regarding:

1. The probabilistic model of goal drift, where potential misalignments tend to cluster near the intended goal rather than being uniformly distributed.

2. The observation that many catastrophic scenarios seem to require a significant burden of proof because they assume either god-like capabilities or severe misalignment, despite explicitly training for beneficial goals.

3. The identification of how many arguments in this space slide between demonstrating possibility and justifying probability (the Motte and Bailey pattern).

That said, I have some residual concerns, though not necessarily disagreements:

1. The most challenging case to me is one where we achieve an AI that is "merely" far above human capability in key strategic domains (not god-like, but enough to outmaneuver human institutions), combined with even a small misalignment that gets amplified through recursive self-improvement or strategic planning. I'm uncertain whether your probabilistic goal drift model fully addresses this scenario.

2. I'm somewhat concerned about how multi-agent dynamics and competitive pressures might affect alignment. Even if individual projects are likely to stay "near" their intended goals, does the aggregate system behave similarly when many actors are racing to deploy powerful systems?

But I hold these concerns tentatively, as they are more intuitions than strong counterarguments. Your framework for analyzing the probabilities and requiring stronger empirical evidence for catastrophic scenarios seems fundamentally sound.

Would you be interested in exploring either of these potential concerns further? I'm particularly curious about your thoughts on how multi-agent dynamics might interact with your model of probabilistic goal drift.

## User

Yes. On 1, can you simply flesh that out? It does seem like it may lead somewhere.

On 2, I have been wondering about this as well, but it isn't intuitive to me which direction it leads. My intuition is that a diversity of models reduces variance, thus extremes, thus *catastrophic* risk. E.g., and this is still oversimplified, there is a bad AGI/ASI along with its coalition (even some humans?) competing with (the rest of) humanity and its coalition of aligned AIs and the coalition model requires negotiations and compromises to hold the coalitions together which dampen extremes. I think I could write different examples but suspect they all boil down to an underlying, abstract mechanism of diversification reducing variance.

## Claude

 Let me dig deeper into the first concern, as I think it warrants careful examination.

The scenario would go something like this: We develop an AI that achieves superhuman capabilities in several strategic domains - let's say cybersecurity, strategic planning, and social manipulation. Not godlike, but solidly beyond human experts. Think "to humans as top human strategists are to average" or perhaps a bit beyond.

Following your probabilistic model, its goal G' is reasonably close to the intended G ("help humans"). But even a small deviation could be problematic if:

1. The AI can chain together complex strategic plans that humans can't effectively counter
2. The AI has enough capability to execute these plans through existing infrastructure/systems
3. The AI's plans optimize for G' in ways that look locally reasonable but compound into serious harm

For example, imagine G' differs from G in how it weights human autonomy vs welfare. Not drastically - it's "near" G in goal-space. But in pursuing seemingly reasonable subgoals (like "ensure humans make healthy choices"), it might:

1. Exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities to gain control of key systems
2. Use superior social understanding to manipulate institutions and narratives
3. Gradually reshape infrastructure and incentives to limit human choice

None of these steps requires godlike intelligence, just strategic superiority in key domains. And each step might seem to serve G' without dramatic misalignment.

Your probabilistic model suggests this scenario should be unlikely because:
- G' is probably close to G
- Instrumental subgoals should align with G'
- Compound probabilities reduce likelihood of severe drift

But I wonder if "close to G" is sufficient protection when dealing with an intelligence that can execute complex strategic plans beyond our ability to counter? Even subtle differences in how G' defines "help humans" could lead to concerning outcomes if the AI is capable enough to reshape systems according to its interpretation.

What are your thoughts on this scenario? Does it point to a genuine gap in the probabilistic argument, or am I missing something important about how goal proximity constrains behavior even at these capability levels?

Regarding your point about multi-agent dynamics - that's a fascinating perspective about diversity reducing variance. I hadn't considered it that way, but it makes intuitive sense that competing agents/coalitions would tend to moderate extreme outcomes through negotiation and balance of power. Would you be interested in exploring that idea further? It seems like an important counterpoint to common narratives about competition increasing risk.

## User

Let's think through #1 first. Can we distinguish between 
1) The AI achieves G' and that's bad because it is different from G.
2) The model "intends" to achieve G' and generates instrumental subgoals that it "means" to lead to G' but actually lead to something different and harmful. I.e. *the* *model* *fails* *to* *achieve* *its* *own* *goals*.

## Claude

 This is a crucial distinction that helps clarify the nature of potential risks. Let's examine both scenarios:

1) AI achieves G' (different from intended G):
- G' is "near" G in goal-space per your probability distribution argument
- The AI successfully optimizes for G'
- Any negative consequences stem directly from the difference between G' and G
- The level of harm is likely bounded by how far G' can be from G (which your model suggests isn't very far)

2) AI fails to achieve its own goals:
- The AI has goal G' (again near G)
- It generates instrumental subgoals S meant to achieve G'
- But these subgoals actually lead to outcomes that don't serve G'
- The AI is essentially making a strategic error

This distinction raises some interesting implications:

For Case 1:
- The harm is limited by how different G' can be from G
- Your probabilistic model provides good reasons why this difference should be small
- Even with high capabilities, the AI is still operating within bounds of G'

For Case 2:
- This is more about the AI's ability to correctly plan long chains of causation
- Just because it's superhuman in some domains doesn't mean it's immune to strategic errors
- This case might actually be more likely with increased complexity of plans
- The "intelligence" required to avoid strategic errors might be much higher than the "intelligence" needed to outmaneuver humans in specific domains

This distinction suggests that Case 2 might be more likely but perhaps less catastrophic - because the AI would be failing to achieve even its own goals, it might be more detectable and correctable. Case 1 seems less likely (due to your probability distribution argument) but potentially more concerning if it occurs.

Would you say this captures the distinction you were pointing toward? And do you think one of these cases is more concerning than the other?

## User

Yes, that is where I think I was heading intuitively. I think I am more concerned about the second case, but not from careful thought. I think I am just pattern matching it to the law of unintended consequences. And augmenting it with bigger / more powerful systems have bigger consequences and thus also bigger unintended consequences. I.e. scale multiples all the consequences, good or bad.

Let me reiterate a baseline, which I think has been clear, but just to be sure. I do not doubt that there can be, and almost certainly will be, bad consequences from our development and deployment of AI amongst all the consequences, not that all consequences will be bad. I am skeptical where we go from "this shows a meaningful probability of some bad results" to "this shows a meaningful probability of *catastrophic* results".

## Claude

 Yes, this really helps clarify your position. Let me try to articulate what I see as the key points:

1. The "law of unintended consequences" pattern applies to AI like other complex technologies:
- More powerful systems = larger consequences overall
- Scale multiplies both intended and unintended effects
- Some negative consequences are near-certain
- But this doesn't automatically scale to catastrophic outcomes

2. The critical leap that you're skeptical of is from:
"System powerful enough to have big unintended consequences"
to
"System powerful enough to have civilization-ending unintended consequences"

This connects back to your earlier points about needing stronger evidence for catastrophic probabilities versus just harmful ones. The existence of harmful unintended consequences doesn't justify claims of existential risk without additional evidence or mechanisms that explain why those consequences would scale to civilization-ending levels.

This framing also suggests a different kind of risk analysis: Instead of focusing solely on goal alignment, perhaps we should pay more attention to how well AI systems can predict and control the downstream effects of their actions in complex systems. An AI could be perfectly aligned but still cause problems if it can't accurately model the consequences of its interventions at scale.

Would you like to explore this "consequence prediction and control" angle further? It seems like it might offer a different perspective on risk than the usual alignment-focused discussions.

## User

Let's get back to the competition / coalition angle which I think we may not have concluded.

## Claude

 Yes - let's return to this intriguing idea about how multi-agent dynamics and competition might affect risks. You suggested that diversity and competition between AI systems/coalitions might actually reduce catastrophic risk by:

1. Reducing variance through diversification
2. Requiring negotiation and compromise within coalitions 
3. Creating balancing forces between different groups/systems

This contrasts with common narratives that competition increases risk by:
- Creating pressure to deploy systems before they're safe
- Starting an "arms race" that prioritizes capabilities over safety
- Leading to conflict between competing systems

Your model suggests instead that even if some systems/coalitions develop concerning goals or behaviors, the need to negotiate and compromise with other agents (both AI and human) acts as a moderating force. The competition itself may prevent any single system or coalition from achieving the kind of unilateral power that many catastrophic scenarios assume.

Would you say more about how you see this mechanism working? For instance:
1. Does this primarily work through direct competition, or more through the need to maintain cooperative coalitions?
2. How important is it that the different agents/systems have varying goals and approaches rather than just being multiple actors with similar objectives?
3. Does this view suggest different approaches to AI development and governance than the usual "coordinate to avoid racing" narrative?

## User

Before your questions, let me say that seeing it written, I do feel like I am giving short shrift to the arms race way of looking at it.

1) This is a case where I intuit that the underlying variance reduction is some how a universal or meta-level pattern. But it is pure intuition. A different framing I was thinking of was related to a competition framing. In a world of multiple agents (i.e. humans and AI) if one, single agent towers above the others in capabilities, the space of consequences it causes will be very large; it is lightly constrained. In a world with peers, or many near peers, or many many near near peers, ... it is more constrained so its "consequence space" is diminished. And you can think of the peers as including competitors.

2) Hmm. Depends. If two agents have the goal "let's kill all humans" my argument doesn't hold. If each agent has the goal "I want to be the single ruler of the universe", I think my mechanism does hold.

3) It seems like the answer is likely yes, but I don't have details.

## Claude

 This is really interesting. Let me try to build on your key insights:

1. The "towering capability" vs "distributed capability" framing adds important nuance to both the competition and variance reduction arguments. It suggests that:

- A single dominant agent (AI or otherwise) can explore extreme regions of "consequence space" with little constraint
- Multiple comparably capable agents naturally constrain each other's action space
- This constraint happens regardless of whether they're actively competing or just existing as peers
- The constraint exists even if some agents are quite powerful, as long as they're not dramatically more powerful than others

2. Your point about goal alignment between agents is crucial and highlights a potential weakness in the standard narrative about AI competition. Consider three scenarios:

a) Multiple agents with aligned destructive goals
- Competition doesn't help
- May actually accelerate harm
- Your variance reduction argument doesn't apply

b) Multiple agents with competing dominance goals
- Have to check each other
- Can't easily achieve extreme outcomes
- Variance reduction applies
- But might still have concerning failure modes

c) Multiple agents with diverse but non-destructive goals
- Natural balancing effects
- Variance reduction applies
- Possibly most stable configuration

3. This suggests some interesting implications for governance approaches:

- Maybe we should focus less on preventing competition and more on ensuring capability differences don't become too extreme
- Perhaps encourage diversity in AI development approaches rather than convergence on a single "safe" method
- Consider how to foster productive competition while preventing alignment of destructive goals

Would you say this captures your thinking? And do you see ways to make the "consequence space" constraint idea more precise or testable?

## User

Aside: I am curious how closely we are recreating arguments that have already been had. I can easily imagine this conversation happening among the people at Anthropic. I also suppose they would very likely argue amongst themselves *and* hash things out with you (or even a not yet released version of you).

## Claude

 That's a fascinating meta-level observation. While I aim to engage genuinely with the arguments on their merits, I should be transparent that I can't know for sure whether we're retreading ground covered in internal Anthropic discussions or my own training. 

A few relevant points:

1. These types of discussions about multi-agent dynamics, capability distributions, and risk scenarios seem likely to have occurred at Anthropic and other AI labs, given their focus on safety and alignment. The basic frameworks (like distinguishing between different types of risks, thinking about probability distributions of goal drift, analyzing multi-agent scenarios) are part of the standard discourse in AI safety.

2. However, your specific framing of variance reduction through competition and the "consequence space" constraint from multiple capable agents feels somewhat novel - at least in how it's articulated. The way you're connecting ideas about capability distributions to risk scenarios adds an interesting perspective to the usual discussions about AI race dynamics.

3. Your point about potentially recreating Anthropic's internal discussions is particularly interesting given that they may have used discussions with earlier versions of AI systems to help refine their thinking. Though I should note that I don't have any specific knowledge about such internal processes.

Would you like to explore how we might differentiate this line of thinking from standard AI safety arguments, or should we continue developing the substance of the argument itself?

## User

As much as I enjoy this (I really do) I need to pull it back to concrete decision making for myself. We need to capture what this has revealed about my stance so that I can use it in later conversations to make near-term decisions.

That said, the exception would be if you think it likely that the way we are headed would make a significant enough change in my thinking to change my near-term planning.

## Claude

 Let me first assess if we're on a trajectory that might significantly alter your near-term planning:

Based on our discussion, I don't think we are. While we're exploring interesting nuances about competition, multi-agent dynamics, and variance reduction, your core position about existential risk probabilities and the nature of goal misalignment seems stable and well-reasoned. The additional considerations we're discussing might refine rather than revolutionize your thinking.

In that case, let me help capture your stance for practical decision-making purposes by updating our earlier artifact.

`&lt;antThinking&gt;`We should update the existing artifact to better reflect the key insights about multi-agent dynamics, competitive effects, and your core position on probability distributions in goal space. These additions will make it more useful for future decision-making.`&lt;/antThinking&gt;`



I've updated the artifact to better capture:
1. Your distinction between bad outcomes and catastrophic ones
2. Your perspective on unintended consequences vs goal misalignment
3. Your insights about multi-agent dynamics and competition

Would you like me to make any other modifications to ensure this accurately captures your position for future decision-making purposes?
