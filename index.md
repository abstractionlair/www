About me:
* [My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-mcguire-2a7081b)

Here are a few personal projects to check out.  Each contains code I've written
for fun or as a learning exercise.  For contractual reasons I can't
show code that I've worked on professionally or even personal projects
that are too similar.
* [A distributed, lisp-like interpreter](https://github.com/abstractionlair/delicious) with shared caching.
* [A non-distributed scheme interpreter](https://github.com/abstractionlair/scheme3) closer to a normal one.
* [The NBody problem](https://github.com/abstractionlair/NBody), from the computer language benchmarks game, in Haskell.
* [Red-black, AVL, and other trees](https://github.com/abstractionlair/Trees) in Haskell.
